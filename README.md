# Design-And-Analysis-functions-
01. Adding Numbers Using Functions
      The code defines a user-defined function named addNumbers.
      It takes two input arguments x and y.
      The function returns the sum of the two input numbers.
      The result is stored in the output variable sum.
      This demonstrates the basics of function creation and usage in MATLAB.

02. User Defined Function:
      The code defines a user-defined function named myFunction.
      It has no input arguments and no output arguments.
      When called, the function displays a message using the disp function.
      This is an example of a simple function used for displaying text or executing a task without needing input or returning a value.

03. Doing Arithmetic Operations:
      The function operations demonstrates how to return multiple outputs from a MATLAB function.
      It takes two input arguments, a and b.
      The function performs four basic arithmetic operations:
                  Addition (add = a + b)
                  Subtraction (sub = a - b)
                  Multiplication (multi = a * b)
                  Division (div = a / b)
      All four results are returned as separate output variables.
      This showcases MATLAB’s capability to return multiple values from a single function call.

04. Finding factorial Without Using Function:
      The code prompts the user to enter a number using input().
      It initializes the variable fact to 1, which will store the factorial result.
      A for loop runs from 1 to the entered number x.
      In each iteration, fact is multiplied by the current value of i to compute the factorial.
      After the loop, the result is displayed using disp() and num2str() to convert numbers to strings.

With Function:
      The function myFact is designed to compute the factorial of a number x using recursion.
      It takes a single input argument x.
      The base case is defined: if x is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1.
      For other values, it calls itself recursively: factorial = x * myFact(x - 1).
      
05.
    The function greet demonstrates a user-defined function with one input and no output.
    It takes a single input argument name.
    The function displays a personalized greeting message using disp() and string concatenation.
    It does not return any value, making it suitable for output-only tasks.

06.
    The function getPi is a user-defined function with no input and one output.
    It simply returns the approximate value of π (pi) as 3.1416.
    This demonstrates:
          How to create a function that returns a constant value.
          Use of no input arguments.
          Use of an output variable to return a result.
